Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others


<a name="speech1">KING HENRY IV</a>

<a name="1.1.1">So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</a>
<a name="1.1.2">Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</a>
<a name="1.1.3">And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</a>
<a name="1.1.4">To be commenced in strands afar remote.</a>
<a name="1.1.5">No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</a>
<a name="1.1.6">Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</a>
<a name="1.1.7">Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</a>
<a name="1.1.8">Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</a>
<a name="1.1.9">Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,</a>
<a name="1.1.10">Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</a>
<a name="1.1.11">All of one nature, of one substance bred,</a>
<a name="1.1.12">Did lately meet in the intestine shock</a>
<a name="1.1.13">And furious close of civil butchery</a>
<a name="1.1.14">Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</a>
<a name="1.1.15">March all one way and be no more opposed</a>
<a name="1.1.16">Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</a>
<a name="1.1.17">The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</a>
<a name="1.1.18">No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</a>
<a name="1.1.19">As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,</a>
<a name="1.1.20">Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</a>
<a name="1.1.21">We are impressed and engaged to fight,</a>
<a name="1.1.22">Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</a>
<a name="1.1.23">Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</a>
<a name="1.1.24">To chase these pagans in those holy fields</a>
<a name="1.1.25">Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</a>
<a name="1.1.26">Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</a>
<a name="1.1.27">For our advantage on the bitter cross.</a>
<a name="1.1.28">But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</a>
<a name="1.1.29">And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:</a>
<a name="1.1.30">Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</a>
<a name="1.1.31">Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</a>
<a name="1.1.32">What yesternight our council did decree</a>
<a name="1.1.33">In forwarding this dear expedience.</a>


<a name="speech2">WESTMORELAND</a>

<a name="1.1.34">My liege, this haste was hot in question,</a>
<a name="1.1.35">And many limits of the charge set down</a>
<a name="1.1.36">But yesternight: when all athwart there came</a>
<a name="1.1.37">A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</a>
<a name="1.1.38">Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</a>
<a name="1.1.39">Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</a>
<a name="1.1.40">Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</a>
<a name="1.1.41">Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</a>
<a name="1.1.42">A thousand of his people butchered;</a>
<a name="1.1.43">Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</a>
<a name="1.1.44">Such beastly shameless transformation,</a>
<a name="1.1.45">By those Welshwomen done as may not be</a>
<a name="1.1.46">Without much shame retold or spoken of.</a>


<a name="speech3">KING HENRY IV</a>

<a name="1.1.47">It seems then that the tidings of this broil</a>
<a name="1.1.48">Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</a>
